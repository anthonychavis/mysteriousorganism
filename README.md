## Introduction

A team of marine biologists found a mysterious organism near hydrothermal vents along the seabed. The organism has only 15 DNA bases that frequently mutate. Since the specimen can't survive above sea level and it is difficult to locate it at the seabed, I used an IIFE to created objects to simulate the specimen for the team to study.

## Technologies

## Extra Info

-   ## About the [program][main-program-file]:
    -   I tried to use inferred typing as much as possible.
        -   For a while, I got away with not needing an interface.
            -   When object typing is required, I prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects because the interface enables stronger typing.
                <!-- -   Challenged myself to -->
                <!-- -   It is simplified to a function that will -->
                <!-- -   _could've _ -->

<!-- Thinking using a class for the pAequorFactory would be the best in this situation b/c repeatedly making new instances of the object. That poses an extra challenge for me b/c I'm not so familiar with using TS on Classes. -->

<!-- Also thinking the survivingOrganisms object needs a method (can't remember at the moment which fxn it needs) -->

<!--
A lot is different from Codecademy's practice project.

-   Critique:
    -   I'm open to criticism; very much want to improve rapidly
    -   If you notice something weird, or unsafe, or have food for thought, please don't hesitate to let me know
