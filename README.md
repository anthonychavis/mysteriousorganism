## Introduction

Marine biologists found a mysterious organism near hydrothermal vents along the seabed. The organism has only 15 DNA bases that frequently mutate. Since it can't survive above sea level and is difficult to locate at the seabed, I created objects using an IIFE that simulate the specimen for the team to study.

## Technologies

## Extra Info

-   ### About the [creating the organism objects][main-program-file]:
    -   I tried to use inferred typing as much as possible.
        -   For a while, I got away with not needing an interface.
            -   When object typing is required, I prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects because the interface is for them.
                <!-- -   Challenged myself to -->
                <!-- -   It is simplified to a function that will -->
                <!-- -   _could've _ -->

<!-- Thinking using a class for the pAequorFactory would be the best in this situation b/c repeatedly making new instances of the object. That poses an extra challenge for me b/c I'm not so familiar with using TS on Classes. -->

<!-- Also thinking the survivingOrganisms object needs a method (can't remember at the moment which fxn it needs) -->

A lot is different from Codecademy's practice project.

-   Critique:
    -   I'm open to criticism; very much want to improve rapidly
    -   If you notice something weird, or unsafe, or have food for thought, please don't hesitate to let me know
